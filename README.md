# SVOT-ROBOT
SVOT-Robot is a robot that is built with VRC components, but comprised of code that I have built and been testing for the sake of self-growth. This robot was made from the scraps of previous years so the price was relatively inexpensive, but the most important aspect is the effort to code the robot utilizing object-oriented programing and inverse trigonometry.
